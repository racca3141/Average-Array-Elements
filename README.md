# Average-Array-Elements

Create a program that calculates the average of 5 array elements.  Make use of an array to store the values.
const int size = 5;
double data[size];
Send this array to a function that actually calculates and returns the average.
1. Tell the user what the program does.
2. Prompt the user to enter the integer scores.  ( Use a for loop to do this. )
3. Create and implement a function with prototype:  ( Use a for loop to do this. )
double average( int a[], const int size);
4. Output the results in the main function.
5. Ask the user if he wishes to run the program again.
